# ZATCA Signing and Phase 2 QR Plan

Last updated: 2026-05-16

## Scope and boundary

This plan is local-only signing groundwork and Phase 2 QR readiness planning for LedgerByte. It does not implement real XML signing, CSID requests, production credentials, clearance/reporting, PDF/A-3, or real ZATCA network calls. It must not be used as a production compliance claim.

## Official findings

- The SDK readme documents `fatoora -sign -invoice <filename> -signedInvoice <filename>`, `fatoora -qr -invoice <filename>`, and `fatoora -generateHash -invoice <filename>`.
- The SDK readme says the SDK certificate and private key under `Data/Certificates` are dummy and for testing purposes only.
- The SDK config points at `cert.pem`, `ec-secp256k1-priv-key.pem`, schema, Schematron, PIH, and input paths.
- The data dictionary maps `KSA-14` QR to `cac:AdditionalDocumentReference` with `cbc:ID = QR` and `mimeCode = text/plain`.
- The data dictionary maps `KSA-15` cryptographic stamp to `ext:UBLExtensions` plus main UBL `cac:Signature` with `cbc:ID = urn:oasis:names:specification:ubl:signature:Invoice` and `cbc:SignatureMethod = urn:oasis:names:specification:ubl:dsig:enveloped:xades`.
- Official samples include `ext:UBLExtensions`, `sig:UBLDocumentSignatures`, `sac:SignatureInformation`, XMLDSig `ds:Signature`, XAdES signed properties, embedded `ds:X509Certificate`, QR `AdditionalDocumentReference`, and main UBL `cac:Signature`.
- Schematron rules `BR-KSA-27`, `BR-KSA-28`, `BR-KSA-29`, and `BR-KSA-30` validate QR/cryptographic stamp structure. Schematron text also describes the hash transform excluding `ext:UBLExtensions`, `cac:Signature`, and QR `AdditionalDocumentReference`.
- The security features PDF states XAdES signing requires `ds:SignedInfo`, canonicalization, ECDSA SHA-256 signature method, at least two references, `ds:SignatureValue`, `ds:KeyInfo`, `ds:X509Certificate`, `xades:SignedProperties`, signing time, signing certificate references, and signature policy information.
- The security features PDF states previous invoice hash uses the same transform as the cryptographic stamp and SHA-256.
- Phase 2 QR fields include tags 1-5 plus tag 6 XML hash, tag 7 ECDSA signature of the XML hash, tag 8 ECDSA public key from the signing private key, and tag 9 ZATCA technical CA signature for simplified invoices and notes.
- The XML implementation PDF delegates QR and electronic signature details to the security features PDF.

## Signing workflow design

1. Generate unsigned UBL XML locally using the existing invoice XML builder.
2. Confirm seller, buyer, invoice, EGS, and XML readiness.
3. Resolve official SDK command plan for `fatoora -sign -invoice <filename> -signedInvoice <filename>` without executing by default.
4. Require a real certificate lifecycle before signing: CSR generation, compliance CSID/certificate, validation in simulation/sandbox, then production CSID/certificate in a later production phase.
5. Use secure key custody before enabling signing. Do not store private key material in ordinary application tables.
6. Sign only in an isolated local/temp working directory when a future controlled local dummy-material experiment is explicitly enabled.
7. Validate signed XML locally with the official SDK before any future network integration.
8. Regenerate Phase 2 QR after signing so signature-dependent QR tags are based on the final signed artifact.

## Key and certificate lifecycle

- CSR config depends on common name, serial number, organization identifier, organization unit, organization name, country, invoice type, location address, and business category.
- Compliance CSID/certificate is required before safe signing validation can be considered.
- Production CSID/certificate must wait for a separate production onboarding phase.
- The SDK dummy certificate/private key may only be used for isolated test experiments and must never be stored as tenant credentials or treated as production material.
- Production key custody should use KMS/HSM-backed signing or an equivalent controlled signing service with audit logs, key rotation, access control, and no private key disclosure to app logs or API responses.

## Invoice hash relationship to signing

- The official transform for hash/signature excludes `ext:UBLExtensions`, main UBL `cac:Signature`, and QR `AdditionalDocumentReference`.
- Existing local hash-chain work remains separate from real signing. The signing plan must not mutate ICV, PIH, invoice hash, EGS last hash, or metadata.
- Final production signing must reconcile app-stored invoice hash, SDK hash, signed XML digest, and QR tag 6.

## Phase 2 QR relationship to signing

- Current LedgerByte QR is basic local QR groundwork and must not be presented as complete Phase 2 QR.
- Phase 2 QR tags 6-9 depend on XML hash, ECDSA signature, public key, and, for simplified invoices/notes, the ZATCA technical CA signature of the cryptographic stamp.
- QR `AdditionalDocumentReference` remains the XML location for QR payloads. It must be regenerated after signing so cryptographic tags match the signed XML and certificate material.

## Local SDK signing possibility

- The SDK documents `-sign`, but LedgerByte does not execute it by default.
- `GET /sales-invoices/:id/zatca/signing-plan` returns a dry-run command plan only.
- A future optional script may use SDK dummy material only in a temp directory if official behavior is confirmed end-to-end and the user explicitly approves it.
- The current default remains `ZATCA_SDK_SIGNING_EXECUTION_ENABLED=false`.

## What must not be done

- Do not use production credentials.
- Do not request CSIDs in this phase.
- Do not submit to ZATCA.
- Do not persist SDK dummy private keys or certificates to tenant records.
- Do not log private key or certificate contents.
- Do not mark invoices as signed, cleared, reported, or production compliant.
- Do not generate fake Phase 2 QR tags.

## Validation strategy

- Normal backend tests must not require Java or SDK execution.
- Unit tests assert signing readiness blockers, dry-run signing plan shape, no private key exposure, production compliance false, and no metadata/EGS mutations.
- Smoke asserts settings and invoice readiness remain local-only and blocked for signing/Phase 2 QR/PDF-A-3 while local XML generation continues.
- Fresh-EGS SDK validation should be rerun only when XML output or hash behavior changes.

## Known blockers

- XAdES signing implementation is not present.
- Certificate lifecycle is not implemented beyond local CSR/mock CSID scaffolding.
- Private key custody/KMS/HSM is not configured.
- Phase 2 QR cryptographic tags are not implemented.
- PDF/A-3 embedding is not implemented.
- Real clearance/reporting APIs are still disabled by design.

## Staged implementation plan

1. Keep current dry-run signing plan and readiness blockers.
2. Add a controlled local dummy-material SDK signing experiment only if explicitly approved.
3. Add signed XML parsing/validation tests from official signed samples.
4. Design key custody using KMS/HSM or equivalent controlled signing service.
5. Implement compliance-certificate handling in a non-production environment with explicit user approval.
6. Generate Phase 2 QR after signed XML is available and validated.
7. Add PDF/A-3 only after signed XML and QR behavior are stable.
8. Add real ZATCA network integration only in a separate production-readiness phase with credentials and legal/compliance review.
## ZATCA key custody and CSR onboarding planning (2026-05-16)

- Added local-only CSR/key-custody planning based on the repo-local official SDK readme, `Configuration/usage.txt`, `Configuration/config.json`, CSR config templates/examples under `Data/Input`, compliance CSID/onboarding/renewal PDFs, XML/security implementation PDFs, data dictionary, signed samples, Schematron rules, and UBL/XAdES/XMLDSig XSDs.
- Added `GET /zatca/egs-units/:id/csr-plan` as a dry-run, no-mutation, no-network endpoint. It returns official CSR config keys, available values, missing values, planned temp file names, blockers, warnings, and redacted certificate/key state. It never returns private key PEM, CSID secrets, binary security tokens, OTPs, or production credentials.
- Extended ZATCA readiness with `KEY_CUSTODY` and `CSR` sections: raw database PEM is flagged as non-production custody risk, missing compliance/production CSIDs remain blockers, certificate expiry is unknown, renewal/rotation workflows are missing, and KMS/HSM-style production custody is recommended.
- Updated ZATCA settings UI to show key custody, CSR readiness, compliance CSID, production CSID, renewal status, and certificate expiry visibility. No real Request CSID, signing, clearance/reporting, PDF/A-3, or production-compliance action was enabled.
- Schema changes: none. Existing raw private-key storage is only detected and flagged; this phase intentionally avoids adding production secret storage fields.
- Remaining limitations: no invoice signing, no CSID requests, no production credentials, no real ZATCA network calls, no clearance/reporting, no PDF/A-3, and no production compliance claim.

## 2026-05-16 - ZATCA CSR dry-run workflow

- Official CSR references inspected: reference/zatca-einvoicing-sdk-Java-238-R3.4.8/Readme/readme.md; reference/zatca-einvoicing-sdk-Java-238-R3.4.8/Configuration/usage.txt; reference/zatca-einvoicing-sdk-Java-238-R3.4.8/Configuration/config.json; reference/zatca-einvoicing-sdk-Java-238-R3.4.8/Data/Input/csr-config-template.properties; reference/zatca-einvoicing-sdk-Java-238-R3.4.8/Data/Input/csr-config-example-EN.properties; reference/zatca-einvoicing-sdk-Java-238-R3.4.8/Data/Input/csr-config-example-EN-VAT-group.properties; reference/zatca-docs/20220624_ZATCA_Electronic_Invoice_Security_Features_Implementation_Standards.pdf; reference/zatca-docs/20220624_ZATCA_Electronic_Invoice_XML_Implementation_Standard_vF.pdf; reference/zatca-docs/compliance_csid.pdf; reference/zatca-docs/EInvoice_Data_Dictionary.xlsx; reference/zatca-docs/onboarding.pdf; reference/zatca-docs/renewal.pdf.
- Added local/non-production CSR dry-run scaffolding via `POST /zatca/egs-units/:id/csr-dry-run` and `corepack pnpm zatca:csr-dry-run`.
- Dry-run behavior is sanitized and no-mutation: no CSID request, no ZATCA network call, no invoice signing, no clearance/reporting, no PDF/A-3, no production credentials, and `productionCompliance: false`.
- Temp planning uses OS temp files only when explicitly requested; missing official CSR fields block config preparation instead of using fake values.
- `ZATCA_SDK_CSR_EXECUTION_ENABLED` defaults to `false`; SDK CSR execution remains skipped in this safe phase and only the command plan is returned.
- Redaction guarantee: private key PEM, certificate bodies, CSID/token content, OTPs, and generated CSR bodies are not returned or logged by the dry-run response/script.

## 2026-05-16 Update: ZATCA CSR onboarding field capture

- Official sources inspected: `reference/zatca-einvoicing-sdk-Java-238-R3.4.8/Readme/readme.md`, `Configuration/usage.txt`, `Configuration/config.json`, `Data/Input/csr-config-template.properties`, `Data/Input/csr-config-example-EN.properties`, `Data/Input/csr-config-example-EN-VAT-group.properties`, `reference/zatca-docs/compliance_csid.pdf`, `onboarding.pdf`, `renewal.pdf`, `20220624_ZATCA_Electronic_Invoice_Security_Features_Implementation_Standards.pdf`, `20220624_ZATCA_Electronic_Invoice_XML_Implementation_Standard_vF.pdf`, and `EInvoice_Data_Dictionary.xlsx`.
- Official CSR config keys modeled from SDK templates/examples: `csr.common.name`, `csr.serial.number`, `csr.organization.identifier`, `csr.organization.unit.name`, `csr.organization.name`, `csr.country.name`, `csr.invoice.type`, `csr.location.address`, and `csr.industry.business.category`.
- Field ownership: VAT/organization identifier, legal name, country code, and business category remain seller/ZATCA profile data; CSR common name, structured serial number, organization unit name, invoice type capability flags, and location address are captured as non-secret EGS onboarding metadata because the official examples are EGS/unit-specific and LedgerByte must not infer them.
- Schema change: nullable non-secret fields were added on `ZatcaEgsUnit`: `csrCommonName`, `csrSerialNumber`, `csrOrganizationUnitName`, `csrInvoiceType`, and `csrLocationAddress`. No private key, certificate, token, OTP, or CSID secret fields were added.
- API change: `PATCH /zatca/egs-units/:id/csr-fields` captures only those non-secret fields, requires `zatca.manage`, rejects production EGS units, trims values, blocks newlines/control characters/equals signs, and currently accepts only the official SDK example invoice type value `1100` until broader official values are modeled.
- CSR plan/dry-run behavior: `GET /zatca/egs-units/:id/csr-plan`, `POST /zatca/egs-units/:id/csr-dry-run`, and `corepack pnpm zatca:csr-dry-run` now use captured fields. Missing required CSR fields still block temp config preparation; captured fields become `AVAILABLE`; review-only fallbacks remain visible where values are not explicitly captured.
- UI change: ZATCA settings now includes a compact non-production EGS CSR field editor with local-only helper text: no CSID request, no ZATCA call, and no secrets.
- Safety guarantees: field capture does not generate CSR files, execute the SDK, request CSIDs, call ZATCA, sign invoices, mutate ICV/PIH/hash-chain fields, enable clearance/reporting, implement PDF/A-3, or claim production compliance. Responses and audit payloads remain redacted from private key/cert/token/OTP/CSR body content.
- Remaining limitations: signing, compliance CSID request, production CSID request, production credentials, clearance/reporting, PDF/A-3, real ZATCA network calls, SDK CSR execution, and production compliance remain intentionally out of scope.
- Recommended next step: add a controlled non-production CSR file-preparation review screen that previews sanitized SDK config output and keeps SDK execution disabled until an explicit onboarding phase approves it.

## 2026-05-16 - ZATCA CSR config preview

- Official sources inspected for this slice: SDK Readme/readme.md, Configuration/usage.txt, Configuration/config.json, Data/Input/csr-config-template.properties, Data/Input/csr-config-example-EN.properties, Data/Input/csr-config-example-EN-VAT-group.properties, compliance_csid.pdf, onboarding.pdf, renewal.pdf, the ZATCA XML and security implementation PDFs, and EInvoice_Data_Dictionary.xlsx under reference/.
- The SDK CSR template/examples use plain single-line key=value entries in this order: csr.common.name, csr.serial.number, csr.organization.identifier, csr.organization.unit.name, csr.organization.name, csr.country.name, csr.invoice.type, csr.location.address, csr.industry.business.category.
- Added a local-only sanitized CSR config preview for non-production EGS units at GET /zatca/egs-units/:id/csr-config-preview. It returns localOnly, dryRun, noMutation, noCsidRequest, noNetwork, productionCompliance false, canPrepareConfig, stable configEntries, missing/review fields, blockers, warnings, and sanitizedConfigPreview.
- The preview includes only captured/profile non-secret CSR values. It does not include private keys, certificate bodies, CSID tokens/secrets, portal one-time codes, generated CSR bodies, production credentials, invoice signatures, clearance/reporting payloads, or PDF/A-3 output.
- The preview does not write files, execute the SDK, request CSIDs, call ZATCA, mutate EGS ICV, mutate EGS lastInvoiceHash, or create submission logs. Production EGS units are rejected for this preview.
- The existing CSR dry-run now reuses the sanitized config formatter before writing temporary CSR config files, while SDK CSR execution remains intentionally skipped and disabled by default.
- ZATCA settings now shows a per-non-production-EGS CSR config preview card with readiness, missing/review fields, sanitized key=value text, and no CSID/no network/no secrets/no SDK execution disclaimers.
- Remaining limitations are unchanged: no SDK CSR execution, no compliance CSID request, no production CSID request, no invoice signing, no production credentials, no clearance/reporting, no PDF/A-3, no real ZATCA network calls, and no production compliance claim.
- Recommended next step: add an operator review/approval record for sanitized CSR config previews before any future controlled local SDK CSR generation phase.

## ZATCA CSR config review workflow update (2026-05-16)

- `reference/zatca-docs/20220624_ZATCA_Electronic_Invoice_XML_Implementation_Standard_vF.pdf`
- `reference/zatca-docs/EInvoice_Data_Dictionary.xlsx`

Implemented local-only operator review tracking for sanitized non-production CSR config previews:
- Added `ZatcaCsrConfigReview` records with `DRAFT`, `APPROVED`, `SUPERSEDED`, and `REVOKED` status.
- Stored only sanitized `key=value` CSR config preview text, official key order, config hash, missing/review/blocker metadata, operator approval fields, and audit-friendly notes.
- Added endpoints to create/list reviews and approve/revoke review records.
- New reviews supersede previous active reviews for the same EGS unit so only the latest preview review remains active.
- Approval is blocked when the current preview has missing fields, blockers, or a changed config hash.
- `POST /zatca/egs-units/:id/csr-dry-run` now reports `configReviewRequired`, `latestReviewId`, `latestReviewStatus`, and `configApprovedForDryRun` for future controlled SDK CSR planning.
- The ZATCA settings UI shows review status, config hash, approval metadata, and create/approve/revoke actions next to the sanitized CSR config preview.
- Audit logs capture create/approve/revoke actions without private keys, certificate bodies, CSID tokens, one-time portal codes, generated CSR bodies, or production credentials.

Safety boundary remains unchanged:
- No SDK CSR execution is implemented.
- No compliance CSID or production CSID request is made.
- No invoice signing, clearance/reporting, PDF/A-3, real ZATCA network call, production credentials, or production compliance claim is enabled.

Recommended next step:
- Add an explicitly gated, temp-directory-only local CSR file preparation review gate that requires an approved review hash before any future non-production SDK CSR execution experiment.

## 2026-05-16 - ZATCA CSR local generation gate

Official local references inspected for this phase:
- `reference/zatca-einvoicing-sdk-Java-238-R3.4.8/Readme/readme.md`
- `reference/zatca-einvoicing-sdk-Java-238-R3.4.8/Configuration/usage.txt`

- `reference/zatca-docs/20220624_ZATCA_Electronic_Invoice_XML_Implementation_Standard_vF.pdf`
- `reference/zatca-docs/EInvoice_Data_Dictionary.xlsx`

Implemented local-only behavior:
- Added a disabled-by-default CSR local generation gate at `POST /zatca/egs-units/:id/csr-local-generate` and `corepack pnpm zatca:csr-local-generate`.
- The gate requires `ZATCA_SDK_CSR_EXECUTION_ENABLED=true`, a non-production EGS unit, an `APPROVED` CSR config review, a current preview hash matching the approved review, no missing CSR fields, and no preview blockers.
- When the flag is false, no SDK process runs, no temp private key is generated, no CSR is generated, and the response reports `executionEnabled=false`, `executionAttempted=false`, and `executionSkipped=true`.
- When the flag is true and all prerequisites pass, the app writes only a temp CSR config file, runs the official SDK CSR command plan with temp private-key and generated-CSR paths, summarizes sanitized stdout/stderr, and deletes the temp directory by default.
- Responses, logs, reviews, smoke output, and UI do not expose private key PEM, generated CSR body, certificate bodies, CSID token material, OTP values, or production credentials.
- The gate does not request compliance CSIDs, does not request production CSIDs, does not call ZATCA network endpoints, does not sign invoices, does not perform clearance/reporting, does not implement PDF/A-3, and keeps `productionCompliance=false`.

UI and validation notes:
- ZATCA settings now shows that local SDK CSR generation requires an approved review and the disabled-by-default env gate.
- Default smoke calls the local generation endpoint with the default disabled flag and verifies no SDK execution, no secret content, no EGS ICV/hash mutation, and no submission-log creation.
- Normal tests mock SDK execution and do not require Java or the official SDK.

Recommended next step:
- Add a controlled non-production operator flow to intentionally enable the CSR gate in a local sandbox session, run the SDK CSR command once with temp files, and manually inspect only sanitized metadata before any future CSID onboarding design.

## 2026-05-16 - Local ZATCA signing dry-run and Phase 2 QR gate

- Official sources inspected: SDK Readme/readme.md, Configuration/usage.txt, Configuration/config.json, official simplified/standard invoice samples, official standard credit/debit samples, SDK certificate/private-key fixture paths, BR-KSA Schematron rules, UBL XAdES/XMLDSig schemas, XML implementation standard PDF, security features implementation standard PDF, and EInvoice_Data_Dictionary.xlsx.
- Added local-only signing dry-run groundwork through `POST /sales-invoices/:id/zatca/local-signing-dry-run` and `corepack pnpm zatca:local-signing-dry-run`.
- `ZATCA_SDK_SIGNING_EXECUTION_ENABLED` defaults to `false`. With the default setting, no SDK signing execution, no QR generation, no temp private-key usage, no signed XML output, no CSID request, no ZATCA network call, and no persistence occurs.
- If explicitly enabled for local/non-production work, the planned path writes unsigned XML to temporary files, attempts the official SDK `-sign` command, plans/runs the SDK `-qr` step only after a signed XML is detected, sanitizes stdout/stderr, and cleans temporary files by default.
- Redaction guarantees: responses and logs must not include private key PEM, certificate bodies, CSID tokens, OTPs, full signed XML bodies, generated CSR bodies, or QR payload bodies.
- Phase 2 QR status: blocked until signed XML, certificate, hash, and signature artifacts are available. The current UI/API exposes the dependency chain instead of fabricating cryptographic QR tags.
- Production limitations remain: no compliance CSID request, no production CSID request, no production credentials, no clearance/reporting, no PDF/A-3, no real ZATCA network calls, and no production compliance claim.
- Recommended next step: run a controlled non-production SDK signing experiment only after approved CSR/test certificate material exists and the operator explicitly enables the local execution gate.

## 2026-05-16 - Controlled local ZATCA signing experiment

Scope: local SDK signing/Phase 2 QR experiment only. No CSID request, no ZATCA network call, no clearance/reporting, no PDF-A3, no production credentials, no signed XML persistence, and no production-compliance claim.

- reference/zatca-docs/EInvoice_Data_Dictionary.xlsx

Confirmed from official references:
- The SDK documents local `fatoora -sign -invoice <file> -signedInvoice <file>` and `fatoora -qr -invoice <file>` commands.
- Simplified invoices require the cryptographic stamp/UBL signature structures and Phase 2 QR path; BR-KSA-28, BR-KSA-29, BR-KSA-30, and BR-KSA-60 remain expected until valid signing material and QR generation are in place.
- The official samples contain the required signature IDs `urn:oasis:names:specification:ubl:signature:1`, `urn:oasis:names:specification:ubl:signature:Invoice`, and signature method `urn:oasis:names:specification:ubl:dsig:enveloped:xades`.
- The bundled SDK certificate/private key files are treated as SDK dummy/test material only and must not be used as production credentials.

Implementation updates:
- Hardened `POST /sales-invoices/:id/zatca/local-signing-dry-run` so `ZATCA_SDK_SIGNING_EXECUTION_ENABLED=true` still requires a generated XML, invoice metadata, active EGS, writable temp directory, Java SDK readiness, SDK launcher/config readiness, explicit SDK dummy certificate/private key availability, no production credentials, no network-like command plan, and no persistence.
- Rewrites SDK config into a temp directory for any future local signing attempt so official config keys point at repo-local SDK paths and dummy test material without returning certificate/private-key content.
- Response now distinguishes `executionStatus`, `signingExecuted`, `qrExecuted`, dummy material readiness, temp SDK config writing, signed XML detection, QR detection, SDK exit codes, sanitized stdout/stderr, blockers, warnings, and cleanup.
- UI now surfaces local signing execution status plus whether SDK signing or QR commands actually executed.
- Default smoke remains safe with `ZATCA_SDK_SIGNING_EXECUTION_ENABLED=false` and verifies execution is skipped.

Controlled local experiment result:
- Experiment invoice: `INV-000163` / `faa19714-abdd-4732-a012-283b5d4ff8c6`, generated locally as `SIMPLIFIED_TAX_INVOICE` with ICV 33 for this test.
- Command: `corepack pnpm zatca:local-signing-dry-run -- --invoice-id faa19714-abdd-4732-a012-283b5d4ff8c6` with `ZATCA_SDK_SIGNING_EXECUTION_ENABLED=true` set only for that command.
- Java observed: OpenJDK 17.0.16.
- SDK path: `reference/zatca-einvoicing-sdk-Java-238-R3.4.8`.
- Result: `executionEnabled=true`, `executionAttempted=false`, `executionSkipped=true`, `executionStatus=SKIPPED`.
- Blocker: detected Java 17.0.16 is outside the SDK-supported range `>=11 <15`.
- SDK exit code: not applicable because execution was correctly blocked before SDK invocation.
- `signedXmlDetected=false`; `qrDetected=false`; `sdkExitCode=null`; `qrSdkExitCode=null`.
- Temp files written: unsigned XML false, SDK config false, signed XML false.
- Cleanup: no temp files required; cleanup reported success.
- Optional local validation of signed temp XML was skipped because no signed XML was produced.

Security and redaction guarantees:
- No private key PEM, certificate body, CSID token, OTP, generated CSR body, signed XML body, or QR payload body is returned or stored.
- No invoice metadata is marked signed.
- No signed XML or QR is persisted to the database.
- The dry-run path does not request CSIDs, does not call ZATCA, and does not submit invoices.
- The path remains a local engineering experiment and does not prove production compliance.

Remaining blockers and next step:
- Install/use an officially supported Java runtime for the SDK experiment, preferably Java 11, then rerun the gated local experiment with SDK dummy/test material only.
- Even if local dummy signing succeeds later, production signing remains blocked until proper compliance/production CSID onboarding, key custody, certificate handling, clearance/reporting design, and production validation are implemented.

## 2026-05-16 - Java 11 controlled ZATCA SDK signing experiment

Scope: local-only SDK signing and QR experiment with SDK dummy/test material. No CSID request, no ZATCA network call, no invoice submission, no clearance/reporting, no PDF-A3, no production credentials, no signed XML persistence, and no production-compliance claim.

- reference/zatca-docs/EInvoice_Data_Dictionary.xlsx

Confirmed official behavior:
- The SDK readme requires Java versions `>=11` and `<15`.
- The documented local signing command is `fatoora -sign -invoice <filename> -signedInvoice <filename>`.
- The documented QR command is `fatoora -qr -invoice <filename>`.
- SDK bundled `cert.pem` and `ec-secp256k1-priv-key.pem` are dummy/testing material only and are not production credentials.
- Simplified invoices require the signature/cryptographic stamp structure and QR flow; official rules include BR-KSA-27, BR-KSA-28, BR-KSA-29, BR-KSA-30, and BR-KSA-60.
- The official simplified sample includes `ext:UBLExtensions`, `sac:SignatureInformation`, signature ID `urn:oasis:names:specification:ubl:signature:1`, referenced signature/signature ID `urn:oasis:names:specification:ubl:signature:Invoice`, signature method `urn:oasis:names:specification:ubl:dsig:enveloped:xades`, and a `QR` additional document reference.

Java runtime configuration:
- Default Java remains OpenJDK `17.0.16` from `C:\Users\Ahmad\AppData\Local\Programs\Eclipse Adoptium\jdk-17.0.16.8-hotspot\bin\java.exe`.
- Supported local Java used for the experiment: `C:\Program Files\Microsoft\jdk-11.0.26.4-hotspot\bin\java.exe`.
- Java 11 version output: OpenJDK `11.0.26` Microsoft build `11.0.26+4-LTS`.
- No global Java change was made; the command used `ZATCA_SDK_JAVA_BIN` only for the local experiment process.

Wrapper hardening added:
- The official Windows `fatoora.bat` expands `FATOORA_HOME` without quotes, so the repo path `E:\Accounting App` broke the launcher under Java 11.
- The local signing wrapper now stages the SDK launcher, JAR, `jq`, and `global.json` into the existing no-space temp directory before execution.
- The temp SDK config is still rewritten only in temp storage and points at SDK dummy/test certificate/private-key material.
- `tempFilesWritten.sdkRuntime` reports whether the temporary SDK runtime staging occurred.
- The sales invoice ZATCA panel displays whether the temp SDK runtime was staged.
- `corepack pnpm zatca:local-signing-dry-run -- --help` now documents `ZATCA_SDK_JAVA_BIN`.

Controlled signing/QR experiment result:
- Invoice: `INV-000163` / `faa19714-abdd-4732-a012-283b5d4ff8c6`.
- Invoice type: `SIMPLIFIED_TAX_INVOICE`.
- Local ICV: `33` from the previously generated unsigned XML.
- Command: `corepack pnpm zatca:local-signing-dry-run -- --invoice-id faa19714-abdd-4732-a012-283b5d4ff8c6` with `ZATCA_SDK_SIGNING_EXECUTION_ENABLED=true` and `ZATCA_SDK_JAVA_BIN` set to Java 11 for that command only.
- Result: `executionEnabled=true`, `executionAttempted=true`, `executionSkipped=false`, `executionStatus=SUCCEEDED_LOCALLY`.
- `signingExecuted=true`; `qrExecuted=true`.
- `sdkExitCode=0`; `qrSdkExitCode=0`.
- `signedXmlDetected=true`; `qrDetected=true`.
- `tempFilesWritten`: unsigned XML true, SDK config true, SDK runtime true, signed XML true, files retained false.
- Cleanup: performed true, success true, temp files removed by default.
- Sanitized SDK output: signing reported `InvoiceSigningService - invoice has been signed successfully`; QR reported `QrGenerationService - Qr has been generated successfully`; QR payload body was redacted.

Optional local validation of signed temp XML:
- A second keep-temp run was used only long enough to validate `signed.xml` locally, then the temp directory was deleted.
- Validation command used the temp staged SDK launcher/config and Java 11, with no ZATCA network call and no CSID request.
- Validation exit code: `0`.
- XSD: PASSED.
- EN: PASSED.
- KSA: PASSED.
- QR: PASSED.
- SIGNATURE: PASSED.
- PIH: FAILED.
- GLOBAL: FAILED.
- Remaining warning: `BR-KSA-08` seller identification warning in the local demo data.
- Remaining error: `KSA-13` PIH invalid. This is expected for the isolated dummy signing experiment because the signed temp artifact is not persisted and the hash chain/PIH is not mutated or promoted as an official signed invoice.

Redaction and no-mutation guarantees:
- No private key PEM, certificate body, CSID token, OTP, signed XML body, generated CSR body, or QR payload body is returned or stored.
- Signed XML is temp-only and deleted by default.
- The validation temp directory from the keep-temp run was manually deleted after validation.
- No invoice metadata is marked signed.
- No signed XML or QR payload is persisted to the database.
- No ICV, PIH, invoice hash, previous hash, EGS last hash, or submission log is mutated by the local signing dry-run path.

Remaining limitations and next step:
- This proves the local SDK dummy-material signing/QR path can execute under Java 11 only; it does not prove production compliance.
- Production signing remains blocked until real compliance/production CSID onboarding, secure key custody, certificate lifecycle handling, official clearance/reporting behavior, PDF-A3, and production validation are implemented.
- Recommended next step: add an explicit local signed-XML validation dry-run endpoint/script that keeps signed XML temp-only, returns only sanitized validation categories, and continues to block all CSID/network/persistence behavior.

### ZATCA local signed XML validation dry-run update (2026-05-16)

- Added a local-only signed XML validation dry-run path for generated invoices: `POST /sales-invoices/:id/zatca/local-signed-xml-validation-dry-run` and `corepack pnpm zatca:local-signed-xml-validate -- --invoice-id <id>`.
- Official references inspected for this phase: SDK `Readme/readme.md`, `Configuration/usage.txt`, `Configuration/config.json`, `Data/PIH/pih.txt`, SDK dummy `Data/Certificates/cert.pem`, SDK dummy `Data/Certificates/ec-secp256k1-priv-key.pem`, standard/simplified SDK invoice samples, ZATCA Schematron rules, XML Implementation Standard PDF, Security Features Implementation Standards PDF, and `EInvoice_Data_Dictionary.xlsx`.
- Behavior: when `ZATCA_SDK_SIGNING_EXECUTION_ENABLED=false`, signing, QR, and signed XML validation are skipped and the response stays dry-run/no-mutation. When explicitly enabled in local/dev only, the service signs and QR-generates temp XML with SDK dummy/test material, rewrites the temp SDK `pihPath` to invoice metadata `previousInvoiceHash`, validates the signed temp XML, sanitizes XSD/EN/KSA/QR/SIGNATURE/PIH/GLOBAL output, then cleans temp files by default.
- PIH/KSA-13 finding: the earlier signed-temp validation PIH failure was caused by SDK validation reading the default configured PIH file instead of an invoice-specific previous hash. The new temp `pihPath` override fixed the controlled local validation for demo invoice `INV-000163`: XSD/EN/KSA/QR/SIGNATURE/PIH/GLOBAL all passed with validation exit code `0`.
- Seller identification: BR-KSA-08 readiness now reports missing or invalid seller ID scheme/number, and XML emits seller `cac:PartyIdentification` only when the seller ID scheme is one of `CRN`, `MOM`, `MLS`, `SAG`, `OTH`, or `700` and the value is alphanumeric. Existing generated XML must be regenerated after adding valid seller ID data to clear an existing BR-KSA-08 warning.
- Safety guarantees: no CSID request, no ZATCA network call, no invoice submission, no clearance/reporting, no PDF/A-3, no production credentials, no signed XML/QR persistence, no ICV/PIH/hash-chain mutation, and no production compliance claim.
- Recommended next step: add controlled seller profile data repair/regeneration guidance for demo invoices, then design a signed XML promotion workflow separately from this dry-run path.

## ZATCA signed XML promotion planning update (2026-05-16)

- Added a safe signed XML promotion architecture boundary in `docs/zatca/SIGNED_XML_PROMOTION_PLAN.md`.
- Added `GET /sales-invoices/:id/zatca/signed-xml-promotion-plan` as a local-only, dry-run, no-mutation endpoint.
- Added signed artifact promotion readiness blockers for dummy/test material, missing real certificate/CSID, missing production key custody, missing persistence workflow, missing clearance/reporting, and missing PDF/A-3.
- Updated invoice/settings UI readiness to show that local signed XML validation success is not persisted signed invoice state and cannot be promoted from SDK dummy material.
- No signed XML, QR payload, private key, certificate body, CSID token, OTP, generated CSR body, production credential, ZATCA network call, CSID request, clearance/reporting, PDF/A-3, or production compliance claim is introduced.

## ZATCA signed artifact storage planning update (2026-05-16)

- Added metadata-only signed artifact storage planning in `docs/zatca/SIGNED_ARTIFACT_STORAGE_PLAN.md`.
- Added `GET /sales-invoices/:id/zatca/signed-artifact-storage-plan` as a local-only, dry-run, no-mutation endpoint.
- Added signed artifact storage readiness blockers for missing metadata model, object-storage retention, immutable archive, intentionally blocked signed XML body persistence, intentionally blocked QR payload persistence, and missing clearance/reporting linkage.
- Chose no Prisma schema in this phase because no signed artifact state should be persisted until object-storage retention, immutable archive, audit, and redaction rules are approved.
- No signed XML body, QR payload body, SDK execution, CSID request, ZATCA network call, clearance/reporting, PDF/A-3, production credential, or production compliance claim is introduced.

## 2026-05-17 - ZATCA signed artifact metadata-only draft records

- reference/zatca-docs/reporting.pdf
- reference/zatca-docs/clearance.pdf

Findings applied:
- Future clearance/reporting payloads use `uuid`, `invoiceHash`, and a base64 invoice payload, so signed artifact planning keeps invoice metadata visible but does not create submission payloads.
- Official samples and Schematron confirm signed XML, QR, cryptographic stamp, ICV, and PIH are linked artifacts; local validation success is not enough to promote or store production artifacts.
- The new `ZatcaSignedArtifactDraft` table stores planning metadata only: status, source, hashes/sizes placeholders, sanitized validation summary fields, dummy-material flag, promotion blocker reason, and creator audit metadata.
- `signedXmlStorageKey` and `qrPayloadStorageKey` remain null in this task. No signed XML body or QR payload body columns were added.
- New endpoints are local-only: `POST /sales-invoices/:id/zatca/signed-artifact-drafts`, `GET /sales-invoices/:id/zatca/signed-artifact-drafts`, and the expanded `GET /sales-invoices/:id/zatca/signed-artifact-storage-plan`.
- Object-storage capability checks report provider/bucket configuration, unknown write capability, retention/immutability not implemented, tenant-scoped key-prefix planning, and body persistence blocked.
- Production compliance remains false. There are still no CSID requests, no ZATCA network calls, no clearance/reporting, no PDF/A-3, no production credentials, and no signed XML/QR body persistence.

Recommended next step:
- Add a future object-storage probe design that checks write/read/delete capability in an isolated test prefix without storing signed XML bodies, then define retention/immutability controls before any artifact-body persistence.
