# LedgerByte Product Audit v2

Audit date: 2026-05-16

Latest commit audited: `3ed2568` (`Add ZATCA hash-chain replacement groundwork`) plus the current SDK hash persistence opt-in pass.

## Executive Summary

LedgerByte is now a broad accounting SaaS MVP with working local workflows for core AR/AP, banking, reports, documents, inventory controls, manual inventory accounting postings, audit visibility, team/security administration, mock-default email onboarding with opt-in SMTP delivery groundwork, browser smoke coverage, deployment runbooks, and a useful business dashboard.

The product is credible as a local demo and internal accountant-review sandbox. It is not yet production SaaS, and it is not Saudi/ZATCA production-ready. The most important remaining gap is not one missing screen; it is production hardening: provider validation, email queue/retry/webhooks, real object storage migration, backups, monitoring, security controls, formal approval workflows, official tax/compliance validation, and operations.

## Maturity Estimate

| Readiness area | Estimate | Verdict |
| --- | ---: | --- |
| Local demo MVP | 88% | Strong enough for guided demos and internal workflow review. |
| Private beta | 62% | Possible only with carefully selected testers, clear limitations, non-production data, and hands-on support. |
| Production SaaS | 38% | Blocked by operations, storage, email, billing, security hardening, backups, monitoring, and legal/compliance review. |
| Saudi/ZATCA production readiness | 36% | ZATCA remains local/mock/scaffold; official SDK samples pass locally under Java 11, LedgerByte standard fixture now passes SDK global validation, simplified fixture passes XSD/EN/PIH, API-generated standard XML validates locally with warnings, read-only hash comparison exists, and SDK hash persistence can be explicitly enabled for fresh EGS units only. Signing, Phase 2 QR, CSID, clearance/reporting, and PDF-A3 are not implemented. |
| Xero/Wafeq competitor readiness | 45% | Breadth is now meaningful, but production trust, compliance depth, integrations, onboarding, and polish are still behind mature products. |

- Deployment documentation: Vercel/Supabase setup, API root/health/readiness docs, CI database readiness, Supabase security review, deployed E2E runbook.

## Partial Modules

- Dashboard analytics: useful read-only snapshot with lightweight charts and drill-down links, but no customization, saved widgets, advanced charting, or accountant-approved KPI definitions.
- Banking: strong manual reconciliation, but no OFX/CAMT/MT940 parser, live feeds, auto-match, payment gateway, transfer fees, or FX handling.
- Inventory accounting: safe manual posting exists, but no automatic posting, no landed cost, no FIFO cost layers, no serial/batch tracking, no inventory returns workflow, and no historical direct-mode migration.
- Reports: broad operational reports exist, but official VAT return, filing exports, scheduled delivery, report pack controls, and accountant sign-off remain.
- Attachments/storage: upload/download/soft-delete works, new uploaded attachments can use S3-compatible storage when explicitly configured, but database/base64 remains the default and there is no migration executor, generated-document S3 path, scanning, OCR, or retention policy.
- Email: mock/local flow works with rate limits and SMTP can be enabled by env, but there is no retry queue, bounce/webhook handling, domain-auth validation workflow, MFA, or session invalidation.
- ZATCA: extensive local groundwork and docs exist; official SDK sample fixtures now pass locally under Java 11. LedgerByte's local standard XML fixture now passes SDK global validation after supply-date and PIH fallback work, the simplified fixture passes XSD/EN/PIH, API-generated standard XML validates locally with address/identifier warnings, and the app now has no-mutation SDK hash comparison, a dry-run reset plan, and explicit fresh-EGS SDK hash persistence. Signing, Phase 2 QR, CSID, clearance/reporting, and PDF/A-3 remain unimplemented.
- Browser QA: route smoke exists and deployed E2E has run, but no visual regression, no full accounting assertions in browser, and no scheduled CI.

## Not Started

- Real ZATCA hash-chain replacement, signing, compliant XML/signature validation, CSID onboarding, clearance, reporting, and PDF/A-3.
- Real-bucket S3 validation, generated-document object storage, and database-to-S3 migration executor.
- Email provider validation, bounce/retry worker, provider webhooks, and domain authentication.
- Subscription billing, plans, tenant limits, and customer billing.
- MFA, refresh-token rotation, advanced session invalidation, anomaly alerts.
- Live bank feeds, payment gateway integration, bank auto-matching.
- Recurring invoices, quotes/proformas, delivery notes, fixed assets, payroll, project/job costing.
- Background job queue workers for email, exports, cleanup, and scheduled reports.
- Production observability, backups, restore drills, incident runbooks, uptime/error alerting.

## Production Blockers

1. No production email queue/retry, provider webhook, or deliverability/domain-auth setup.
2. Uploaded/generated documents still default to database/base64 storage unless the attachment S3 provider is explicitly configured.
3. No production backup/restore and monitoring runbooks proven against hosted infrastructure.
4. No subscription billing, tenant limits, or SaaS account lifecycle.
5. No MFA, advanced session controls, or formal security review.
6. No immutable external audit store, scheduled audit export, tamper-evident chain, or alerting.
7. No broad maker-checker approval workflow for high-risk accounting changes.
8. No official VAT return filing workflow.
9. No production-grade bank file parser or live bank integration.
10. Supabase RLS remains disabled in the documented test posture; tenant isolation is currently API-layer enforced.

## Compliance Blockers

- ZATCA official XML mapping is incomplete; official SDK samples pass locally under Java 11, the LedgerByte standard fixture now passes SDK global validation, the simplified fixture now passes SDK XSD/EN/PIH, and API-generated standard XML validates locally with warnings, but signing, QR/certificate, CSID, clearance/reporting, and PDF/A-3 remain blockers.
- ZATCA invoice hash/canonicalization has SDK `-generateHash` oracle evidence for fixtures and generated XML. SDK hash persistence now exists only for fresh explicitly enabled EGS units; existing local chains are not migrated and are still development-only.
- ZATCA signing and certificate/key custody are not implemented.
- Compliance CSID and production CSID onboarding are not implemented.
- Clearance/reporting endpoints are intentionally blocked for real network behavior.
- PDF/A-3 invoice archive is not implemented.
- VAT Summary is not an official VAT filing export.
- Audit logs are useful but not immutable or tamper-evident.

## Security Blockers

- No MFA.
- No refresh-token rotation or advanced session invalidation.
- No production email queue/webhook security controls or domain authentication validation.
- No virus scanning for uploaded attachments.
- No signed URL policy, generated-document object-storage path, or object lifecycle/retention enforcement.
- No external immutable audit retention.
- No anomaly detection or admin alerting for sensitive changes.
- No production secrets/key custody design for ZATCA private keys.
- Deployment security review still needs RLS/private networking/least-privilege decisions.

## UX Blockers

- Dashboard has lightweight drill-downs and trend context, but still needs advanced charting, saved preferences, and accountant-approved KPI definitions.
- Many list pages need filters, saved views, bulk actions, and clearer empty states.
- Supplier AP balance wording should be accountant-reviewed.
- Error recovery and validation messages need a product-wide pass.
- No onboarding wizard or setup checklist for new organizations.
- No guided approval inbox for reconciliations, inventory variances, or high-risk actions.
- Attachment upload is functional but not polished for drag/drop, previews, or OCR.

## Accounting-Review Blockers

- Chart of accounts template needs accountant sign-off.
- Report definitions and layouts need accountant sign-off.
- Dashboard KPI definitions need accountant/product sign-off.
- VAT return design needs tax advisor review.
- Fiscal year close and retained earnings workflow is missing.
- Inventory valuation policy needs sign-off before FIFO/landed cost/automatic posting.
- Inventory variance proposal debit/credit policy needs accountant review.
- Direct-mode historical purchase bill policy needs review before any migration or automatic receipt posting.
- Approval thresholds and maker-checker rules are not defined.

## Go/No-Go

| Target | Recommendation |
| --- | --- |
| Local guided demo | GO |
| Internal accountant review | GO |
| Private beta with non-production data | CONDITIONAL GO |
| Paid production SaaS | NO-GO |
| Saudi/ZATCA compliant invoicing | NO-GO |
| Inventory accounting automation | NO-GO until landed cost/FIFO/direct-mode policy is approved |

## Recommended Next Development Focus

1. Stabilize current UX: dashboard chart polish, error/empty states, route QA, and browser smoke expansion.
2. Turn production groundwork into real infrastructure: S3 migration/generated-document storage, email provider, backup/restore, monitoring, and CI gates.
3. Resolve the fresh-EGS SDK-mode generated XML gaps now exposed by local validation: invoice 2 `KSA-13` PIH validation, buyer-address warnings, signing, certificate, and Phase 2 QR before any network calls.
4. Add accountant-reviewed advanced accounting only after current report/dashboard/inventory policies are signed off.
5. Add SaaS business layer after operational foundations are reliable.

## Fresh EGS SDK Hash Validation Update

Update date: 2026-05-16.

The fresh-EGS SDK hash persistence path has now been validated end-to-end locally with Java 11.0.26 and no ZATCA network calls. A zero-metadata EGS was explicitly enabled for `SDK_GENERATED`; two invoices persisted SDK hashes; invoice 2 PIH equaled invoice 1's SDK hash; hash compare returned `MATCH` for both invoices; repeated generation did not mutate ICV or last hash.

Follow-up PIH-chain debugging confirmed the prior invoice 2 `KSA-13` failure was caused by SDK validator configuration: the SDK `-validate` command reads the expected previous hash from `Configuration/config.json` `pihPath`, which defaults to the first-invoice seed in `Data/PIH/pih.txt`. LedgerByte now validates generated invoice chains with a temporary SDK config whose `pihPath` contains the invoice metadata `previousInvoiceHash`. Both generated standard invoices now pass SDK XML validation globally. Production readiness remains unchanged because buyer building-number data, signing, CSID, clearance/reporting, and PDF/A-3 are still absent.

## 2026-05-16 ZATCA buyer address field support

This section supersedes older notes that described `BR-KSA-63` as unresolved because buyer building number was not captured.

Official references inspected for this change:

- `reference/zatca-docs/EInvoice_Data_Dictionary.xlsx`
- `reference/zatca-einvoicing-sdk-Java-238-R3.4.8/Data/Samples/Standard/Invoice/Standard_Invoice.xml`
- `reference/zatca-einvoicing-sdk-Java-238-R3.4.8/Data/Samples/Simplified/Invoice/Simplified_Invoice.xml`
- `reference/zatca-einvoicing-sdk-Java-238-R3.4.8/Data/Samples/Standard/Credit/Standard_Credit_Note.xml`
- `reference/zatca-einvoicing-sdk-Java-238-R3.4.8/Data/Samples/Standard/Debit/Standard_Debit_Note.xml`
- `reference/zatca-einvoicing-sdk-Java-238-R3.4.8/Data/Rules/Schematrons/20210819_ZATCA_E-invoice_Validation_Rules.xsl`
- `reference/zatca-docs/20220624_ZATCA_Electronic_Invoice_XML_Implementation_Standard_vF.pdf`
- `reference/zatca-docs/20220624_ZATCA_Electronic_Invoice_Security_Features_Implementation_Standards.pdf`

Confirmed address rules and mapping:

- `BR-KSA-63` is a warning for standard invoice buyer Saudi addresses when `cac:AccountingCustomerParty/cac:Party/cac:PostalAddress/cac:Country/cbc:IdentificationCode` is `SA` and the standard invoice transaction flag is present.
- The official Schematron requires buyer `cbc:StreetName`, `cbc:BuildingNumber`, `cbc:PostalZone`, `cbc:CityName`, `cbc:CitySubdivisionName`, and `cac:Country/cbc:IdentificationCode` in that Saudi standard-buyer case.
- The Schematron requires the Saudi buyer building number to be present for `BR-KSA-63`; seller building number rule `BR-KSA-37` separately validates seller building number as 4 digits.
- Buyer postal code `BR-KSA-67` expects a 5-digit Saudi postal code when buyer country is `SA`.
- Official standard invoice, standard credit note, and standard debit note samples include buyer postal address fields in this order: `cbc:StreetName`, `cbc:BuildingNumber`, `cbc:CitySubdivisionName`, `cbc:CityName`, `cbc:PostalZone`, `cac:Country/cbc:IdentificationCode`.
- Official simplified invoice samples inspected omit buyer postal address, so buyer address is not treated as mandatory for simplified invoices by this change.
- `Contact.addressLine1` maps to buyer `cbc:StreetName`.
- `Contact.addressLine2` maps to buyer `cbc:AdditionalStreetName` when present; it is no longer used as district.
- `Contact.buildingNumber` maps to buyer `cbc:BuildingNumber`.
- `Contact.district` maps to buyer `cbc:CitySubdivisionName`.
- `Contact.city` maps to buyer `cbc:CityName`.
- `Contact.postalCode` maps to buyer `cbc:PostalZone`.
- `Contact.countryCode` maps to buyer `cac:Country/cbc:IdentificationCode`.
- Buyer province/state `BT-54` is present in the data dictionary but optional for the inspected rules and samples, so no `countrySubentity` contact field was added in this pass.

Implemented scope:

- Added nullable `Contact.buildingNumber` and `Contact.district` fields through Prisma migration `20260516170000_add_contact_zatca_buyer_address_fields`.
- Updated contact create/update DTO validation and API persistence so existing contacts remain valid.
- Added contact UI fields in the address section with ZATCA buyer-address helper text.
- Updated generated ZATCA XML to emit real buyer building number and district data without fake defaults.
- Added local readiness warnings for missing Saudi standard buyer address fields, including missing building number, while preserving XML generation behavior.
- Updated smoke and fresh-EGS demo data with explicit Saudi buyer address values: street, unit/additional street, 4-digit building number, district, city, 5-digit postal code, and country `SA`.

Validation result after this change:

- `corepack pnpm db:generate`: PASS after stopping the stale local API process that locked Prisma's query engine DLL.
- `corepack pnpm db:migrate`: PASS, nullable contact address migration applied locally.
- `corepack pnpm --filter @ledgerbyte/api test -- --runTestsByPath src/contacts/contact.service.spec.ts src/zatca/zatca-rules.spec.ts src/zatca-core.spec.ts`: PASS, 3 suites and 45 tests.
- `corepack pnpm --filter @ledgerbyte/zatca-core test`: PASS, 24 tests.
- `node --check scripts/validate-zatca-sdk-hash-mode.cjs`, `node --check scripts/debug-zatca-pih-chain.cjs`, `node --check scripts/validate-generated-zatca-invoice.cjs`: PASS.
- `corepack pnpm typecheck`: PASS.
- `corepack pnpm build`: PASS.
- `corepack pnpm smoke:accounting`: PASS.
- `corepack pnpm zatca:debug-pih-chain`: PASS with Java 11.0.26, local SDK execution enabled, no network, invoice 1 global PASS, invoice 2 global PASS, PIH chain stable, hash compare MATCH/noMutation for both invoices.
- `corepack pnpm zatca:validate-sdk-hash-mode`: PASS with Java 11.0.26, local SDK execution enabled, no network, invoice 1 global PASS, invoice 2 global PASS, hash compare MATCH/noMutation for both invoices.
- `BR-KSA-63` is cleared for the fresh-EGS generated standard-invoice path when the buyer contact has real `buildingNumber` and `district` data.
- No new buyer-address SDK warnings were introduced in the fresh-EGS validation run.

Validation environment note:

- The repository path contains a space. The official Windows `fatoora.bat` launcher is sensitive to that path shape, so validation used a temporary no-space copy of the official SDK `Apps` folder under `E:\Work\Temp\ledgerbyte-zatca-sdk-nospace` plus a temporary SDK `config.json` pointing back to the official `reference/` `Data`, `Rules`, certificate, and PIH files. This was local-only and did not alter production configuration.

Remaining limitations:

- No invoice signing is implemented.
- No CSID request flow was run.
- No clearance or reporting network call was enabled or submitted.
- No production credentials were used.
- No PDF/A-3 embedding is implemented.
- This is not a production compliance claim; it is customer/contact address support and generated XML cleanup only.

## 2026-05-16 ZATCA seller/buyer readiness checks

- Added local-only ZATCA readiness checks for seller profile invoice XML data, buyer contact invoice XML data, invoice generation state, EGS/hash-chain state, and generated XML availability.
- Official sources inspected: `reference/zatca-docs/EInvoice_Data_Dictionary.xlsx`, `reference/zatca-einvoicing-sdk-Java-238-R3.4.8/Data/Samples/Standard/Invoice/Standard_Invoice.xml`, `reference/zatca-einvoicing-sdk-Java-238-R3.4.8/Data/Samples/Simplified/Invoice/Simplified_Invoice.xml`, standard credit/debit note samples, `reference/zatca-einvoicing-sdk-Java-238-R3.4.8/Data/Rules/Schematrons/20210819_ZATCA_E-invoice_Validation_Rules.xsl`, `reference/zatca-docs/20220624_ZATCA_Electronic_Invoice_XML_Implementation_Standard_vF.pdf`, and `reference/zatca-docs/20220624_ZATCA_Electronic_Invoice_Security_Features_Implementation_Standards.pdf`.
- Rules confirmed: seller invoice XML address checks use `BR-KSA-09`, seller building number format uses `BR-KSA-37`, seller postal code format uses `BR-KSA-66`, seller VAT checks use `BR-KSA-39` and `BR-KSA-40`, standard Saudi buyer postal-address readiness uses `BR-KSA-63`, Saudi buyer postal code format uses `BR-KSA-67`, buyer name standard-invoice warning uses `BR-KSA-42`, and buyer VAT format when present uses `BR-KSA-44`.
- Standard vs simplified behavior: standard-like tax invoices with Saudi buyers require buyer street, building number, district, city, postal code, and country code for clean XML readiness. Simplified invoices do not block on missing buyer postal address when official samples/rules do not require it.
- API changes: `GET /zatca/readiness` now returns detailed readiness sections while preserving legacy local readiness fields. `GET /sales-invoices/:id/zatca/readiness` returns read-only invoice readiness with `localOnly: true`, `noMutation: true`, and `productionCompliance: false`.
- UI changes: the ZATCA settings page shows section readiness cards, the contact detail page shows buyer address readiness for customer contacts, and the sales invoice detail page shows seller/buyer/invoice/EGS/XML readiness near ZATCA actions.
- Safety boundary: readiness checks do not sign XML, request CSIDs, call ZATCA, submit clearance/reporting, generate PDF/A-3, or claim production compliance.
- Recommended next step: improve admin workflows for correcting readiness issues in-place, then rerun local fresh-EGS SDK validation only when XML output changes.

## 2026-05-16 ZATCA signing readiness groundwork

- Added local-only signing readiness and Phase 2 QR readiness planning. This does not sign XML, request CSIDs, use production credentials, submit to ZATCA, clear/report invoices, generate PDF/A-3, or claim production compliance.
- Official sources inspected: SDK `Readme/readme.md`, `Configuration/usage.txt`, `Configuration/config.json`, CSR config templates, `EInvoice_Data_Dictionary.xlsx`, XML implementation PDF, security features PDF, official signed standard/simplified invoice samples, standard credit/debit note samples, Schematron rules, and UBL/XAdES/XMLDSig XSD files under `reference/`.
- Design doc added: `docs/zatca/SIGNING_AND_PHASE_2_QR_PLAN.md`.
- Readiness changes: settings and invoice readiness now expose `signing`, `phase2Qr`, and `pdfA3` sections. These are production blockers, while local unsigned XML generation remains available and explicitly local-only.
- API change: `GET /sales-invoices/:id/zatca/signing-plan` returns a dry-run SDK `fatoora -sign -invoice <filename> -signedInvoice <filename>` command plan with `localOnly: true`, `dryRun: true`, `noMutation: true`, and `productionCompliance: false`.
- Safety behavior: the signing plan never returns private key content, never executes signing by default, never mutates ICV/PIH/hash/EGS metadata, and includes blockers for missing certificate lifecycle, private key custody, compliance CSID, production CSID, Phase 2 QR cryptographic tags, and PDF/A-3.
- Phase 2 QR status: current QR remains basic local groundwork. QR tags that depend on XML hash, ECDSA signature, public key, and simplified-invoice certificate signature remain blocked until signing/certificate work is implemented safely.
- Recommended next step: implement an explicitly disabled local dummy-material SDK signing experiment in a temp directory only after approving its safety envelope, or proceed directly to key-custody/KMS design.

## ZATCA key custody and CSR onboarding planning (2026-05-16)

- Added local-only CSR/key-custody planning based on the repo-local official SDK readme, `Configuration/usage.txt`, `Configuration/config.json`, CSR config templates/examples under `Data/Input`, compliance CSID/onboarding/renewal PDFs, XML/security implementation PDFs, data dictionary, signed samples, Schematron rules, and UBL/XAdES/XMLDSig XSDs.
- Added `GET /zatca/egs-units/:id/csr-plan` as a dry-run, no-mutation, no-network endpoint. It returns official CSR config keys, available values, missing values, planned temp file names, blockers, warnings, and redacted certificate/key state. It never returns private key PEM, CSID secrets, binary security tokens, OTPs, or production credentials.
- Extended ZATCA readiness with `KEY_CUSTODY` and `CSR` sections: raw database PEM is flagged as non-production custody risk, missing compliance/production CSIDs remain blockers, certificate expiry is unknown, renewal/rotation workflows are missing, and KMS/HSM-style production custody is recommended.
- Updated ZATCA settings UI to show key custody, CSR readiness, compliance CSID, production CSID, renewal status, and certificate expiry visibility. No real Request CSID, signing, clearance/reporting, PDF/A-3, or production-compliance action was enabled.
- Schema changes: none. Existing raw private-key storage is only detected and flagged; this phase intentionally avoids adding production secret storage fields.
- Remaining limitations: no invoice signing, no CSID requests, no production credentials, no real ZATCA network calls, no clearance/reporting, no PDF/A-3, and no production compliance claim.

## 2026-05-16 - ZATCA CSR dry-run workflow

- Official CSR references inspected: reference/zatca-einvoicing-sdk-Java-238-R3.4.8/Readme/readme.md; reference/zatca-einvoicing-sdk-Java-238-R3.4.8/Configuration/usage.txt; reference/zatca-einvoicing-sdk-Java-238-R3.4.8/Configuration/config.json; reference/zatca-einvoicing-sdk-Java-238-R3.4.8/Data/Input/csr-config-template.properties; reference/zatca-einvoicing-sdk-Java-238-R3.4.8/Data/Input/csr-config-example-EN.properties; reference/zatca-einvoicing-sdk-Java-238-R3.4.8/Data/Input/csr-config-example-EN-VAT-group.properties; reference/zatca-docs/20220624_ZATCA_Electronic_Invoice_Security_Features_Implementation_Standards.pdf; reference/zatca-docs/20220624_ZATCA_Electronic_Invoice_XML_Implementation_Standard_vF.pdf; reference/zatca-docs/compliance_csid.pdf; reference/zatca-docs/EInvoice_Data_Dictionary.xlsx; reference/zatca-docs/onboarding.pdf; reference/zatca-docs/renewal.pdf.
- Added local/non-production CSR dry-run scaffolding via `POST /zatca/egs-units/:id/csr-dry-run` and `corepack pnpm zatca:csr-dry-run`.
- Dry-run behavior is sanitized and no-mutation: no CSID request, no ZATCA network call, no invoice signing, no clearance/reporting, no PDF/A-3, no production credentials, and `productionCompliance: false`.
- Temp planning uses OS temp files only when explicitly requested; missing official CSR fields block config preparation instead of using fake values.
- `ZATCA_SDK_CSR_EXECUTION_ENABLED` defaults to `false`; SDK CSR execution remains skipped in this safe phase and only the command plan is returned.
- Redaction guarantee: private key PEM, certificate bodies, CSID/token content, OTPs, and generated CSR bodies are not returned or logged by the dry-run response/script.

## 2026-05-16 Update: ZATCA CSR onboarding field capture

- Official sources inspected: `reference/zatca-einvoicing-sdk-Java-238-R3.4.8/Readme/readme.md`, `Configuration/usage.txt`, `Configuration/config.json`, `Data/Input/csr-config-template.properties`, `Data/Input/csr-config-example-EN.properties`, `Data/Input/csr-config-example-EN-VAT-group.properties`, `reference/zatca-docs/compliance_csid.pdf`, `onboarding.pdf`, `renewal.pdf`, `20220624_ZATCA_Electronic_Invoice_Security_Features_Implementation_Standards.pdf`, `20220624_ZATCA_Electronic_Invoice_XML_Implementation_Standard_vF.pdf`, and `EInvoice_Data_Dictionary.xlsx`.
- Official CSR config keys modeled from SDK templates/examples: `csr.common.name`, `csr.serial.number`, `csr.organization.identifier`, `csr.organization.unit.name`, `csr.organization.name`, `csr.country.name`, `csr.invoice.type`, `csr.location.address`, and `csr.industry.business.category`.
- Field ownership: VAT/organization identifier, legal name, country code, and business category remain seller/ZATCA profile data; CSR common name, structured serial number, organization unit name, invoice type capability flags, and location address are captured as non-secret EGS onboarding metadata because the official examples are EGS/unit-specific and LedgerByte must not infer them.
- Schema change: nullable non-secret fields were added on `ZatcaEgsUnit`: `csrCommonName`, `csrSerialNumber`, `csrOrganizationUnitName`, `csrInvoiceType`, and `csrLocationAddress`. No private key, certificate, token, OTP, or CSID secret fields were added.
- API change: `PATCH /zatca/egs-units/:id/csr-fields` captures only those non-secret fields, requires `zatca.manage`, rejects production EGS units, trims values, blocks newlines/control characters/equals signs, and currently accepts only the official SDK example invoice type value `1100` until broader official values are modeled.
- CSR plan/dry-run behavior: `GET /zatca/egs-units/:id/csr-plan`, `POST /zatca/egs-units/:id/csr-dry-run`, and `corepack pnpm zatca:csr-dry-run` now use captured fields. Missing required CSR fields still block temp config preparation; captured fields become `AVAILABLE`; review-only fallbacks remain visible where values are not explicitly captured.
- UI change: ZATCA settings now includes a compact non-production EGS CSR field editor with local-only helper text: no CSID request, no ZATCA call, and no secrets.
- Safety guarantees: field capture does not generate CSR files, execute the SDK, request CSIDs, call ZATCA, sign invoices, mutate ICV/PIH/hash-chain fields, enable clearance/reporting, implement PDF/A-3, or claim production compliance. Responses and audit payloads remain redacted from private key/cert/token/OTP/CSR body content.
- Remaining limitations: signing, compliance CSID request, production CSID request, production credentials, clearance/reporting, PDF/A-3, real ZATCA network calls, SDK CSR execution, and production compliance remain intentionally out of scope.
- Recommended next step: add a controlled non-production CSR file-preparation review screen that previews sanitized SDK config output and keeps SDK execution disabled until an explicit onboarding phase approves it.

## 2026-05-16 - ZATCA CSR config preview

- Official sources inspected for this slice: SDK Readme/readme.md, Configuration/usage.txt, Configuration/config.json, Data/Input/csr-config-template.properties, Data/Input/csr-config-example-EN.properties, Data/Input/csr-config-example-EN-VAT-group.properties, compliance_csid.pdf, onboarding.pdf, renewal.pdf, the ZATCA XML and security implementation PDFs, and EInvoice_Data_Dictionary.xlsx under reference/.
- The SDK CSR template/examples use plain single-line key=value entries in this order: csr.common.name, csr.serial.number, csr.organization.identifier, csr.organization.unit.name, csr.organization.name, csr.country.name, csr.invoice.type, csr.location.address, csr.industry.business.category.
- Added a local-only sanitized CSR config preview for non-production EGS units at GET /zatca/egs-units/:id/csr-config-preview. It returns localOnly, dryRun, noMutation, noCsidRequest, noNetwork, productionCompliance false, canPrepareConfig, stable configEntries, missing/review fields, blockers, warnings, and sanitizedConfigPreview.
- The preview includes only captured/profile non-secret CSR values. It does not include private keys, certificate bodies, CSID tokens/secrets, portal one-time codes, generated CSR bodies, production credentials, invoice signatures, clearance/reporting payloads, or PDF/A-3 output.
- The preview does not write files, execute the SDK, request CSIDs, call ZATCA, mutate EGS ICV, mutate EGS lastInvoiceHash, or create submission logs. Production EGS units are rejected for this preview.
- The existing CSR dry-run now reuses the sanitized config formatter before writing temporary CSR config files, while SDK CSR execution remains intentionally skipped and disabled by default.
- ZATCA settings now shows a per-non-production-EGS CSR config preview card with readiness, missing/review fields, sanitized key=value text, and no CSID/no network/no secrets/no SDK execution disclaimers.
- Remaining limitations are unchanged: no SDK CSR execution, no compliance CSID request, no production CSID request, no invoice signing, no production credentials, no clearance/reporting, no PDF/A-3, no real ZATCA network calls, and no production compliance claim.
- Recommended next step: add an operator review/approval record for sanitized CSR config previews before any future controlled local SDK CSR generation phase.

## ZATCA CSR config review workflow update (2026-05-16)

Implemented local-only operator review tracking for sanitized non-production CSR config previews:
- Added `ZatcaCsrConfigReview` records with `DRAFT`, `APPROVED`, `SUPERSEDED`, and `REVOKED` status.
- Stored only sanitized `key=value` CSR config preview text, official key order, config hash, missing/review/blocker metadata, operator approval fields, and audit-friendly notes.
- Added endpoints to create/list reviews and approve/revoke review records.
- New reviews supersede previous active reviews for the same EGS unit so only the latest preview review remains active.
- Approval is blocked when the current preview has missing fields, blockers, or a changed config hash.
- `POST /zatca/egs-units/:id/csr-dry-run` now reports `configReviewRequired`, `latestReviewId`, `latestReviewStatus`, and `configApprovedForDryRun` for future controlled SDK CSR planning.
- The ZATCA settings UI shows review status, config hash, approval metadata, and create/approve/revoke actions next to the sanitized CSR config preview.
- Audit logs capture create/approve/revoke actions without private keys, certificate bodies, CSID tokens, one-time portal codes, generated CSR bodies, or production credentials.

Safety boundary remains unchanged:
- No SDK CSR execution is implemented.
- No compliance CSID or production CSID request is made.
- No invoice signing, clearance/reporting, PDF/A-3, real ZATCA network call, production credentials, or production compliance claim is enabled.

Recommended next step:
- Add an explicitly gated, temp-directory-only local CSR file preparation review gate that requires an approved review hash before any future non-production SDK CSR execution experiment.

## 2026-05-16 - ZATCA CSR local generation gate

Official local references inspected for this phase:

- `reference/zatca-docs/EInvoice_Data_Dictionary.xlsx`

Implemented local-only behavior:
- Added a disabled-by-default CSR local generation gate at `POST /zatca/egs-units/:id/csr-local-generate` and `corepack pnpm zatca:csr-local-generate`.
- The gate requires `ZATCA_SDK_CSR_EXECUTION_ENABLED=true`, a non-production EGS unit, an `APPROVED` CSR config review, a current preview hash matching the approved review, no missing CSR fields, and no preview blockers.
- When the flag is false, no SDK process runs, no temp private key is generated, no CSR is generated, and the response reports `executionEnabled=false`, `executionAttempted=false`, and `executionSkipped=true`.
- When the flag is true and all prerequisites pass, the app writes only a temp CSR config file, runs the official SDK CSR command plan with temp private-key and generated-CSR paths, summarizes sanitized stdout/stderr, and deletes the temp directory by default.
- Responses, logs, reviews, smoke output, and UI do not expose private key PEM, generated CSR body, certificate bodies, CSID token material, OTP values, or production credentials.
- The gate does not request compliance CSIDs, does not request production CSIDs, does not call ZATCA network endpoints, does not sign invoices, does not perform clearance/reporting, does not implement PDF/A-3, and keeps `productionCompliance=false`.

UI and validation notes:
- ZATCA settings now shows that local SDK CSR generation requires an approved review and the disabled-by-default env gate.
- Default smoke calls the local generation endpoint with the default disabled flag and verifies no SDK execution, no secret content, no EGS ICV/hash mutation, and no submission-log creation.
- Normal tests mock SDK execution and do not require Java or the official SDK.

Recommended next step:
- Add a controlled non-production operator flow to intentionally enable the CSR gate in a local sandbox session, run the SDK CSR command once with temp files, and manually inspect only sanitized metadata before any future CSID onboarding design.

## 2026-05-16 - Local ZATCA signing dry-run and Phase 2 QR gate

- Official sources inspected: SDK Readme/readme.md, Configuration/usage.txt, Configuration/config.json, official simplified/standard invoice samples, official standard credit/debit samples, SDK certificate/private-key fixture paths, BR-KSA Schematron rules, UBL XAdES/XMLDSig schemas, XML implementation standard PDF, security features implementation standard PDF, and EInvoice_Data_Dictionary.xlsx.
- Added local-only signing dry-run groundwork through `POST /sales-invoices/:id/zatca/local-signing-dry-run` and `corepack pnpm zatca:local-signing-dry-run`.
- `ZATCA_SDK_SIGNING_EXECUTION_ENABLED` defaults to `false`. With the default setting, no SDK signing execution, no QR generation, no temp private-key usage, no signed XML output, no CSID request, no ZATCA network call, and no persistence occurs.
- If explicitly enabled for local/non-production work, the planned path writes unsigned XML to temporary files, attempts the official SDK `-sign` command, plans/runs the SDK `-qr` step only after a signed XML is detected, sanitizes stdout/stderr, and cleans temporary files by default.
- Redaction guarantees: responses and logs must not include private key PEM, certificate bodies, CSID tokens, OTPs, full signed XML bodies, generated CSR bodies, or QR payload bodies.
- Phase 2 QR status: blocked until signed XML, certificate, hash, and signature artifacts are available. The current UI/API exposes the dependency chain instead of fabricating cryptographic QR tags.
- Production limitations remain: no compliance CSID request, no production CSID request, no production credentials, no clearance/reporting, no PDF/A-3, no real ZATCA network calls, and no production compliance claim.
- Recommended next step: run a controlled non-production SDK signing experiment only after approved CSR/test certificate material exists and the operator explicitly enables the local execution gate.
